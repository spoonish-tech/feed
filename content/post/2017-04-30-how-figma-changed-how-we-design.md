Do you want your company to still be around 5 years from now?

If you haven't already embraced DevOps practices - or if you're doing it wrong (LINK) - it's high time to remedy this.

Companies in all industries are reaping significant benefits, and it has become a separating factor between low and high performing businesses.

## On the shoulders of giants

Would you rather be Netflix or Blockbuster?

Netflix embraced DevOps practices early, and is one of the best examples of effective DevOps, but they're not alone.

Some other examples are:

* Adidas
* Amazon
* BMW
* Capital One
* Disney
* Etsy
* Facebook
* Google
* IKEA
* Microsoft
* Monzo
* Netflix
* New York Times
* Sony
* Spotify
* Starbucks
* Verizon

And this is just a tip of the iceberg.

## Which effects can you expect to see?

Some common effects of properly adopted DevOps practices include:

* Increased velocity
* Better observability
* Improved business agility
* Shorter time to market
* Decreased bottlenecks
* Better understanding, and implementation of requirements
* Improved automation
* Increased system stability
* More readable code
* Better system architecture
* Efficient and repeatable deployment practices
* Stronger team motivation
* Increased psychological safety
* More efficient support/feedback processes (including on-call)  
    
  Can't quite believe it?

## Trust the statistics

Several independent resources have collected extensive metrics on the effectiveness of DevOps practices. Companies like Puppet, Google, Gitlab, and Splunk all contribute to collect even more statistics. 

For an in-depth analysis of both the findings, the surveys used, and the scientific approach - I strongly recommend picking up the book Accelerate - the science of DevOps, from your favorite book store. 

## And you can measure your progress!

There are a few different sets of DevOps metrics commonly used; I find the ones from DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) useful, because of their ambitious and continuous collection of statistics.

* Deployment Frequency (DF)
* Mean lead time for changes(MLT)
* Change failure rate (CFR)
* Mean time to recovery (MTTR)

Taken together, these are very strong and consistent correlations between the above metrics and business outcomes, regardless of company size and industry.

### Understanding the metrics

#### Deployment Frequency

How often are new features deployed to production?

High deployment frequency usually indicates high velocity, short time to market, and strong agility.

#### Mean lead time for changes

How long does it take for committed code to be deployed to production?

A short mean lead time indicates a lack of bottlenecks, strong autonomy, a high level of trust, and efficient code deployment strategies.

#### Change failure rate

How often does new code in production not work according to expectations?

A low change failure rate indicates correctly understood requirements, working solutions, and stable services.

#### Mean time to recovery

How long does it take from a reported issue in production, until it is working as intended?

A low mean time to recovery can indicate many things, including high system observability, high level of automation, high velocity, efficient support processes, readable code/services, and good system architecture.
